# CSE 15L Lab Report 4

## Reproduce the Task From the Competition
___
## Step 4: Log into ieng6
I pretty much have all the command I need in a note, so I used copy-paste a lot in this process. SSH Keys are super helpful in this particular process as well, it speeds up the login procedures.

Keys Pressed: ```<command-c>, <command-v>, <enter>```

___
## Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
## and Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
Since the procedures are unchanged, I combined multiple lines of command into a single line of command by separating them with semicolons.

Keys Pressed: ```<command-c>, <command-v>, <enter>```

___
## Step 7: Edit the code file to fix the failing test
I opened up the ```nano``` text editor then corrected the faulty part that causes bug. I used ```<control-v>``` to scroll the page of editor faster, then used arrow keys to precisely locate the place that I want to make the change. Then I used ```<control-x>, <y>, <enter>``` to save the change to the original file.

Keys Pressed: ```<command-c>, <command-v>, <enter>, <control-v>, <up>, <up>, <right> x 12, <delete>, <2>, <control-x>, <y>, <enter>```

___
## Step 8: Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
After I fixed the bug, I ran the JUnit test once again. As I mentioned, I just need to copy-paste the code I prepared.

Keys Pressed: ```<command-c>, <command-v>, <enter>```

___
## Step 9: Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account
Then I commit and push the changes to Github, I don't need to authorize myself because I setuped the SSH Key with Github account as well.

Keys Pressed: ```<command-c>, <command-v>, <enter>```
